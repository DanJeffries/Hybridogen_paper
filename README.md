# Hybridogen_paper

Data files, schematics and scripts for the Pelophylax hybridogen paper, predominantly for the phasing analysis of the RADseq data.

All information can be found in the jupyter notebook. It is too large to render on github so you can view it by copying the URL of the notebook file from here, and pasting it into the [Jupyter notebook viewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/)
